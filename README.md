# My_Guitar__Practice_Application

This is a collection of methods I use to hep me practice guitar. I am still working on some of the method.

The following methods are included in the file are:

1. Randomising order of notes in a scale, mode or arpeggio to help practice scales. Can be used on one or more strings.

2. A method that help me memorise the Nashville system of a certain key, e.g C 5,3,1,2. Can also be used to included secondary dominants and secondary diminshed chords

3. A scale/chord chart generator. A method that produce the chords of a scale, and the option to add a secondary scale, the dominant and or diminished chords and the possibility 
to make it only show triads, sevenths, etc... 

In terms of things I would like to with this application, would be to make the methods more efficent, detailing the methods more and maybe adding a nicer user interface.
